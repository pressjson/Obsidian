# "Very Early"

- Composed while an undergraduate
- Adapted into jazz standard in *Moon Beams* (1962)

>Evans told Jim Akain \[in an interview]: 'Bach changed my hand approach to playing the piano. I used to use a lot of finger technique when I was younger, and **I changed over to a weight technique**. Actually, if you play Bach and **the voices sing at all**, and sustain the way they should, you really can't play it with the wrong approach . . .' (Pettinger, 2002)
