1:52, Restatement of the main theme

- Strings are *pizz* to make volume space for the solo
- All strings are below the soloist to make register space for the solo
- Violins have countermelody/echo *p dolce* divisi in octaves across 1 and 2

6:30, Orchestra comes in with theme

- High strings and flute divisi in octaves with theme
- Other winds and brass have harmony and rhythm

18:48, Finale of Mvmt. 1

- Coming from a long gauntlet of violin craziness
- The orchestra is divided into two
	- Flute, oboe, clarinet, upper strings have the melody
	- Cello, bass, bassoon have the countermelody
	- Hillary Hahn has rhythmic octaves/drive, joins melody later
	- Horns/timpani accent melody
