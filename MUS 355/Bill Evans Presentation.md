# Thesis

Bill Evan's background in classical music influenced his jazz career, specifically with the clarity of his chord voicings (i.e. every note is clear) and his jazz compositions.

# "Very Early"

- Composed while an undergraduate
- Adapted into jazz standard in *Moon Beams* (1962)

>Evans told Jim Akain \[in an interview]: 'Bach changed my hand approach to playing the piano. I used to use a lot of finger technique when I was younger, and **I changed over to a weight technique**. Actually, if you play Bach and **the voices sing at all**, and sustain the way they should, you really can't play it with the wrong approach . . .' (Pettinger, 2002)

# "Peace Piece"

- Recorded in *Everybody Digs Bill Evans* (1958)
- Directly inspired by classical piano waltzes with left hand ostinatos
>	Chopin’s Berceuse, Op. 57 in D♭ major, composed in Paris during 1843–4, both as ‘**a piano piece that Evans knew well**’ and as a ‘**clear precursor**’ to ‘Peace Piece.’ (Mawer, 2015)
